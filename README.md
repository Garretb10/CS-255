CS-255 Coursework and Projects


  This class was focused around analysis and improvements relating to a company's software known as "DriverPass". For this class, DriverPass connected with me to create the software that fits their needs. This included an online-based platform that will give driving students practice exams and driving tutoring in-person. The main focus of the projects given in this class was to analyze the technical requirements needed for this software. I feel that I defined the requirements well in the projects. If I had to revise anything, it would probably be what operating system I stated should be used for the backend creation of the software. Instead of Windows, I would probably switch it to Linux as it offers more functionality in the backend development. The user's needs were implemented into the software as they can fully customize information and account data, be presented with a very simple and full UI, as well as storing their long-term information in a cloud system for further assistance with any issues. To approach and design this software, I first looked at what is crucially needed for it, as well as ensure all of DriverPass's needs were implemented in the process.
